**FAQ API Project**
This project is a Django-based API for managing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). It provides multilingual support, integrates a WYSIWYG editor, and uses Redis for caching to optimize performance. The API serves FAQ data in multiple languages, and the data is cached to improve response times.
